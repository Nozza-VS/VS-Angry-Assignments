|credAbility Overlaps:
1. "Siphon" (shadow dog 100) + "Molten" (fire dog 33): 
Everyone stack and keep moving along the pre-assigned direction.
2. "Siphon" (shadow dog 100) + "Gaze" (fire dog 66): 
Siphon will come right after Gaze, people had gaze donâ€™t run too far away from the group, so you can run back in-time for stack.
3. "Siphon"(shadow dog 100) + "Enflame" (fire dog 100): 
Keep stacking, player with fire debuff RUN OUT IMMEDIATELY, if you have both fire and shadow debuff, either soak with BIG CD or immunity, or sac.
Group damage reduction and healing CD needed to survive.
